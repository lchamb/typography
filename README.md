# Typography

A set of basic typographic styles in SASS and CSS. A good starting point for typography, and also designed to be customized to your needs.

## Usage

Import the file _typography.scss as a partial in your scss manifest file somewhere after your normalize or reset file, but as close to the top as possible.

    @import "normalize";
    @import "_typography.scss";

Change the variable `$scale` to match your ratio. The default scale is 3:2 ([Perfect Fifth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth)).
